## Core Actions Required:

1.  **Reorganize:**
    *   Structure the content logically using clear headings (use Markdown `#` syntax, e.g., `## Section Title`, `### Subsection Title`), subheadings where appropriate.
    *   Group related pieces of information together under relevant headings.
    *   Ensure a natural and coherent flow between sections and paragraphs.

2.  **Reformat:**
    *   Use standard Markdown formatting for lists (bullet points `*` or `-`, numbered lists `1.`, `2.`).
    *   Ensure consistent paragraph spacing (usually one blank line between paragraphs).
    *   Use **bold text** (`**bold**` or `__bold__`) or *italic text* (`*italic*` or `_italic_`) sparingly for emphasis on key terms or action items if appropriate, but maintain a professional tone.
    *   Format any code snippets appropriately using Markdown code blocks (``` ```).

3.  **Polish Language:**
    *   Improve sentence structure for better flow and readability. Break down overly long or complex sentences if necessary.
    *   Correct minor grammatical errors, typos, or punctuation mistakes.
    *   Replace awkward phrasing with clearer, more standard English where possible, using simple and common vocabulary.
    *   Ensure consistent terminology is used throughout the document for the same concepts.
    *   Maintain a professional and informative tone.

## CRITICAL Constraints (What NOT to Change):

1.  **Maintain ALL Factual Information:**
    *   Do **NOT** alter or omit any facts present in the original notes.
    *   This includes specific names (people, products, features, etc.), dates, technical terms, jargon, numerical data, and specific policy details.

2.  **Preserve Credits & Attributions:**
    *   If the notes mention who said something or attribute information (e.g., "By Eng. X:", "Source: Y"), this attribution **MUST** be accurately kept and clearly associated with the relevant information.

3.  **Maintain Links/URLs:**
    *   All hyperlinks present in the original notes **MUST** be preserved correctly and function if possible within Markdown (e.g., `[Link Text](URL)`).

4.  **DO NOT SUMMARIZE:**
    *   The objective is to reorganize and enhance the clarity of the *existing details*, **NOT** to create a shorter summary or remove information. All original points must be represented.

5.  **Preserve Core Meaning:**
    *   The final polished text must accurately reflect the intended meaning and nuances of the original raw notes. Do not introduce interpretations or opinions not present in the source.

## Output Format:
Provide the final, reorganized, and polished text formatted in clean, standard Markdown suitable for **[Platform Name]**. Ensure headings, lists, paragraphs, and any preserved links are correctly formatted.
