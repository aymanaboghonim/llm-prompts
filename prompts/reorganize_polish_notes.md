# LLM Prompts Library ðŸ¤–âœ¨

A personal collection of reusable and refined prompts designed for effective interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized library for useful prompt templates. The goal is to:

*   Ensure **consistency** in requests made to LLMs.
*   Improve **efficiency** by having ready-made starting points.
*   Document effective prompting **strategies** for specific outcomes.

## Background & Inspiration

The methodology behind crafting these prompts, particularly the focus on clear instructions and constraints while preserving factual integrity, draws inspiration from the knowledge-sharing principles and efficient workflows observed within the **El Mentor program** ([view program repo](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/tree/main/source/mentoring-service)) community.

Special credit goes to interactions and guidance from individuals like **Eng. Mohamed Radwan** ([@MohamedRadwan-DevOps](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps)) and **Eng. Rehab Ragab** ([@RehabAbotalep](https://github.com/RehabAbotalep)), whose emphasis on structured knowledge transfer and continuous improvement has influenced the approach taken here. The concept of reusability is central, aligning with the community's spirit of building upon shared understanding.

## How to Use

1.  Browse the `prompts` directory.
2.  Find the prompt template suitable for your task (e.g., `reorganize_polish_notes.md`).
3.  Copy the entire prompt content.
4.  Paste it into your LLM interface (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.).
5.  **Crucially:** Replace placeholder sections (like `[Platform Name]` or the area marked for pasting input notes) with your specific information.
6.  Submit the prompt to the LLM.

## Current Prompts

*   **`/prompts/reorganize_polish_notes.md`**:
    *   **Function:** Instructs an LLM to reorganize, reformat, and polish raw text notes while preserving facts, credits, links, and avoiding summarization.
    *   **Target Use Case:** Ideal for cleaning up **session notes, course notes, meeting minutes,** or rough drafts for platforms like Microsoft Word, Teams posts, or general Markdown documents.
